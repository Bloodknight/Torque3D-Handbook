# Packages 
The package keyword tells the console that the subsequent block of code is to be declared but not loaded. Packages provide dynamic function-polymorphism in TorqueScript. In short, a function defined in a package will over-ride the prior definition of a same named function when the is activated. When the package is subsequently de-activated, the previous definition of any overridden functions will be re-asserted.

**A package has the following syntax:**
```cs
package package_name 
{
   function function_definition0() 
   {
      // code
   }

   function function_definitionN() 
   {
      // code
   }
};
```
**Some things to know:**

The same function can be defined in multiple packages. 
Only functions can be packaged. 
Datablocks cannot be packaged. 
Packages 'stack' meaning that deactivating packages activated prior to the currently active (s) will deactivate all packages activated prior to the being deactivated (see example below). 
Functions in a may activate and deactivate packages. 
In order to use the functions in a package, the package must be activated:
```cs
activatePackage(package_name);
```
Subsequently a package can be deactivated:
```cs
deactivatePackage(package_name);
```
## Usage

First, define a function and two packages, each of which provides an alternative definition by the same name.
```cs
function testFunction() 
{
   echo( "testFunction() - unpackaged." );
}

package MyPackage0
{
  function testFunction() 
  {
      echo( "testFunction() - MyPackage0." );
  }
};

package MyPackage1
{
  function testFunction() 
  {
      echo( "testFunction() - MyPackage1." );
  }
};
```
Now invoke the testFunction() function from the console under three different conditions:
```cs
==> testFunction();
testFunction() - unpackaged.

==> activatePackage( MyPackage0 );

==> testFunction(); 
testFunction() - MyPackage0.

==> activatePackage( MyPackage1 );

==> testFunction(); 
testFunction() - MyPackage1.

==> deactivatePackage( MyPackage0 );  // MyPackage1 is automatically deactivated.

==> testFunction(); 
testFunction() - unpackaged.
```
